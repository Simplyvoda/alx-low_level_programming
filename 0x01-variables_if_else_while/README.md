# C - Variables and Loops ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾

## What are Variables ?
Variables are containers for storing data values.
In C, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

- int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
- float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
- char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes

## Looping in C 
Looping involves the use of loop statements which  allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.

### Code Syntax for if .. else loops
```
if (test expression) {
    // run code if test expression is true
}
else {
    // run code if test expression is false
}
```

### Code Syntax for while loop
```
while (test expression) {
    // run code until while expression is true
}
```
