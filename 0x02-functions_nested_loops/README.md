# C - Functions and Nested Loops :triumph: :triumph:
## What are functions ?
A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.

You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
**NOTE:**There must be a ```main``` function which drives the code.
