# C - Pointers, Arrays and Strings :smiley: :smiley: :smiley:
## What are pointers ??
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is âˆ’
```
type *var-name;
```
**NOTE** : **type** is the data type of the of the pointers base.

## Example :
```
int    *iptr;    /* pointer to an integer */
double *dptr;    /* pointer to a double */
float  *fptr;    /* pointer to a float */
char   *chtr     /* pointer to a character */
```
