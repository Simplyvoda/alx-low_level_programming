# C - Function Pointers :smiley::smiley:
Function pointers in C are variables that can store the memory address of functions and can be used in a program to create a function call to functions pointed by them. Function pointers in C need to be declared with an asterisk symbol and function parameters (same as function they will point to) before using them in the program. Declaration of function pointers in C includes return type and data type of different function arguments.

An asterisk ```*```symbol before the pointer name differentiates the function pointer from a usual function declaration. Functions can aspect function pointer as a function argument and later call it inside the function body. Such passed functions are called ```callback function```.
